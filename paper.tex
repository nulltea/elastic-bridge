This paper proposes an approach for secure and robust bridging of ERC-20 compatible rebase tokens between EVM-based source chain and Substrate-based parachain deployed on Polkadot network.

\section{Introduction}

Emerging applications of blockchain technology indicate an ongoing trend for market diversification. Once the idea of sovereignty-preserving application-specific chains became feasible, it quickly displace a single \textit{chain-maximalism} dogma. We are now live in a world where \textit{multi-chain} networks like Polkadot \cite{wood2016polkadot} and Cosmos \cite{kwon2016cosmos} are gathering diverse interconnected applications around their relay-chains and hub-chains respectively, creating \textit{the Internet of Blockchains\footnote{\url{https://cosmos.network}}}.

Frameworks like Parity's Substrate\footnote{\url{https://docs.substrate.io}} and Tendermint's Cosmos SDK\footnote{\url{https://tendermint.com/sdk}} streamlined the process building and deploying of sovereign and flexible blockchains, allowing them to have different consensus mechanisms, finalities, state models, governance, etc.

\subsection{Cross-chain Bridges}

Effectively improved on scalability by shading on-chain data and parallelising transaction execution, we encountered new challenges with cross-chain interoperability. Many newborn ecosystems, all with unique features and value propositions, found themselves near of Tower of Babel\footnote{Myth} --- unable to communicate and effectively cooperate to provide meaningful services together.

The natural reaction was a development of cross-chain bridges --- protocols that allow two (or more) exogenous chains to share state by the means of inter-chain transaction passing. We have seen various implementations of these protocols ranging from trusted federations to truly trust-less decentralized Relayed SPV solutions like the IBC Protocol \cite{goes2020ibc}.

\subsection{Rebase Tokens}

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies --- the original use case of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), also do not show any signs of innovation slowdown. Projects like Stellar \cite{mazieres2016stellar} commit to building a foundation for transferring digital currency to fiat money across borders. Controversial privacy-oriented currencies like Monero \cite{saberhagen2013monero} allow completely untraceable payments. Finally, fiat-pegged tokens like Tether \cite{tether2016} and multi-collateralized stablecoins like MakerDAO's Dai \cite{makerdao2020dai} has been one of many attempts to tackle price-volatility --- issue often synonymous with digital currencies.

Rebasing --- a novel technique applied for synthetic commodities for achieving practical price stability by algorithmically adjusting circulating amount of tokens, thus translating price-volatility into supply-volatility.
