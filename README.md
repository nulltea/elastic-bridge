# ElasticBridge
_A proposed implementation of cross-chain bridge connecting EVM and WASM chains for exchanging rebase tokens in a decentralized, secure and trustless way._ 

## Abstract 
This paper proposes a practical approach for secure and robust bridging of ERC-20 compatible rebase tokens between EVM-based source chain and WASM-based receiver chain via the IBC interoperability protocol.

## Proposal statement
The purpose of this paper is to firstly shed light on the implications that elastic supply of dispatchable tokens would have on cross-chain interoperability protocols applied to them. 

We will then go through key considerations that should be taken into account while designing a bridge for transferring such tokens. The Paper will center around the protocol proposal for the bridge connecting EVM-compatible source chain and WASM-based chain on the Kusama network. 

Finally, we will finish current paper with follow-up questions and ideas for future exploration.
